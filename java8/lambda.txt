Lambda Expression : 
A lambda expression is a short, clean, inline function without a name.
It is mainly used to replace anonymous classes of Functional Interfaces.
Interface reference can be used to hold lamda expression


Using lamda expression we dont need to write separate implementation class 
we can provide implementation in lamda expression.
Example 
// Without Lambda
Runnable r1 = new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
};

// With Lambda
Runnable r2 = () -> System.out.println("Hello");

Rules for lamda
===============
1 . ()-> means a function
2. if single statement remove { }
3 .No need to specify type of argument 
4. No need for return keyword if single statement
5. remove () if one parameter

Basic Syntax
(arguments) -> { body }


Examples:
() -> System.out.println("Hello");
a -> a * a
(a, b) -> a + b

Lambda Works Only With Functional Interfaces Example:
@FunctionalInterface
interface A {
    void show();
}

Use it with lambda:

A obj = () -> System.out.println("Hello");
obj.show();
